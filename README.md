This repository was used in past for the [oh-know workshop](https://www.forbio.uio.no/events/courses/2021/k-mer_workshop) that took place 13. - 16.9.2021. Therefore the name. Although all the tutorials were updated, you can still find the archived version of the tutorials as taught during the workshop [here](https://github.com/KamilSJaron/oh-know/wiki/_ARCHIVE).
