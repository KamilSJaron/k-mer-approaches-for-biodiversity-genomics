## Let's separate some subgenomes!

Here is some pertinent literature:
[Genome evolution in the allotetraploid frog Xenopus laevis](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19840), and 
[Genome biology of the paleotetraploid perennial biomass crop Miscanthus](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18923-6).

## But first
The whole pipeline would look like this:
First, you get a chromosome-resolved genome. Second, you use UCEs (ultra-conserved elements) to obtain chromosome pairs. Third, you assign one chromosome from each pair to either subgenome (e.g. A / B).

Unfortunately I will not be covering steps 1 and two from above. I will be explaining how to do step number 2 in my lecture, and *I will be happy to provide code by e-mail*. In any case, I will record this lecture and host it on YouTube.

## Our example

In a case where we have subgenome A and B, we know the following:
pair01: subgenome A: chr25; subgenome B: chr12
pair02: A: chr6; B: chr7
pair03: A: chr18; B: chr8

This is a simplified example. During the lecture (which I'll be hosting after recording it) I will explain how I went from
